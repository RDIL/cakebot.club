Hello all,
If you are reading this, you are most likely on our new website.

It has been a pretty big migration from Jekyll to Docusaurus, but it is complete.

The reason we decided to make this change is that Jekyll was not the easiest to maintain.
In some cases, the website broke for weeks of time due to a Minima update we didn't know about.

In addition, the new website has a lot of improved features, including a dark theme, better design, and our dependencies can now properly be pinned - no more rouge updates!

If you find any issues with the new site, please don't hesitate to send us a `+report`, we will get on it as soon as we can!

Thank you all :blush:
