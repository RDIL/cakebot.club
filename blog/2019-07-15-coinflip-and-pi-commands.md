With today's new release, Cakebot is able to not only tell you the first 123 digits of Pi, and flip a coin for you.

<!--truncate-->

## Usage

### Coinflip

Simply run `+coinflip` :money_with_wings:

### Pi

Very easy, just go ahead and drop `+pi` in a text channel for your mathematical needs.

And as always, you can find out more about the commands [from the docs](/docs/commands#fun).
