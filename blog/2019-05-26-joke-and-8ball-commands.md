Today we are announcing the `+joke` and `+8` commands.

<!--truncate-->

### `+joke`

This command allows you to get a joke from the bot's collection. Who knows, you may :joy: even if the jokes are bad.

### `+8`

This command allows you to use our legendary magic 8 ball. You need to pass your question as a parameter.
You can read the docs on how to use it [here](/docs/commands#fun).

Thank you for all your support :pray:
