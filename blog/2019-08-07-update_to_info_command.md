A quick update to `+info` has arrived!
This update adds several fields to the output of running the command, including:

- Icon is animated (value is either True or False)
- Server creation time (time in UTC that the server was created)
- More than 250 members (called a 'large' server in the Ds) (value is either True or False)

Happy Discording!
