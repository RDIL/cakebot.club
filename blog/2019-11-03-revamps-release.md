Hello all,
Once again, we are very sorry for the lack of updates. It should get better now.

## Summary

New in this release:

- Development experience has been improved :star:
- Many bugs have been fixed - no more using `+report` without any message :bug:!
- `+homepage` and `+stars` are out of beta and fully into the spotlight. Let us GitHubbers rejoyce!

<!--truncate-->

## New Commands

- `+homepage` - allows you to get the homepage of a GitHub repository if it is set by the owner
- `+stars` - allows you to get the stargazer count of a GitHub repository

## Bugs Fixed

We fixed a lot of bugs that allowed you to run commands without passing needed arguments.
It is now _required_!!

## :tada:

Thank you all for your continued support. It means the world to us.

- The Cakebot Team
