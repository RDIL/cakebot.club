Hello all,
I understand everybody's concerns, and yes, we are coming back.

I'm sorry we haven't posted for 5 months, and here is why:
Demotivation.

But do not worry! It ends here, and I will now tell you what is going to happen in the next month.

## 04-2020

Releasing the April 2020 update is very high priority, and here is what will be in it:

### Self Hosting

Self hosting capabilities will also be improved, with easy-to-use setup and deployment!

### Bugs Fixed

-   `+report` and `+info` will work again
-   The bot will be a lot faster

### ... and more!

## :tada:

Thank you all for your continued support. It means the world to us.
