We take your privacy very seriously.

## Website

When you visit our website (https://cakebot.club and all subpages), we do not store cookies, or use trackers of any kind.
We employ [`DNSSEC` technology](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en), and have SSL enabled at all times!

## On Discord

### Support Tickets

When you file a support ticket, it is publicized while open. It does include your Discord username and tag so we can get back to you.
All tickets are deleted after being closed.

### In General

When using the bot, we store the names and/or the IDs of all Discord guilds that the bot has access to so we can store configurations.

## Change

This privacy policy may change without warning if the team decides.

## Final Notes

Any questions should be directed to our public email (listed in footer).
