# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

To work on it, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to be installed.

### Installation

To install the website's dependencies, run:

```shell
$ yarn
```

You only need to do this the first time, or after you change/update/add/remove a dependency.

### Preview Changes

```shell
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live (or after a reload) without having to restart the server.

### Build

```shell
$ yarn build
```

This command generates the production-ready. static content into the `build` directory.
