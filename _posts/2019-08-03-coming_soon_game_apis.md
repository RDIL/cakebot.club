Hey all,
We would love to hear what games you want to see Discord support for.

This can be anything, meaning this game connects to Discord via Cakebot.

Right now, we have the following integrations being developed:

* CS:GO - Player Counts
* Minecraft - Popular Server APIs

We have the following implementations planned, but still being decided on (meaning there is a potential they will not actually be developed):

* CS:GO - Trading
* Team Fortress 2

Want to see your own game on the list? Use `+report` (make sure to mention the games name) and we will add it if we can!
