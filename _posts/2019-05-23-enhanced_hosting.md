title: "Better Hosting"
---

Today we are announcing enhanced hosting. We have migrated the whole bot runtime infrastructure on to [PythonAnywhere :snake:](https://pythonanywhere.com).

### What does this mean for the developers?

The bot is now fully in sync with GitHub, so changes just need to be pulled from remote.

### What does this mean for users of the bot?

The bot will have doubled uptime to start out. With PythonAnywhere, we are able to keep the bot online without needing anything
on our computers, meaning it will be faster to respond also!

### Conclusion

This migration opens a whole new set of possibilities to us, and we will now be able to push updates quicker!

Thank you for all your support :pray:
