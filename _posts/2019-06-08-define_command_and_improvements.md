We're delighted to announce the new `+define` command, as well as some insights into current and future development.

## New Command

`+define` allows you to define a word from the dictionary easily. It is pretty simple to use, and because of that, we believe it is easier then opening a book or visiting any website.

## Performance Enhancements

Since our last post, we have mainly been working to improve performance, including response times, for the bot. We understand that it is annoying, and it has improved, and will continue to in the coming days!

## Updates to Source Code

We also did a lot of renaming/simplifying/modernizing of code, to make it easier for all of us. We are pretty sure this didn't break anything, but if it did, *please* help us out by filing a report.

## Welcoming a New Sponsor!

We would like to thank [CloudRepo](https://cloudrepo.io) for sponsoring us. Thanks to them, we no longer have to deal with managing packages on PyPI, making our codebase more healthy overall.

## Conclusion

Thank you everyone for your continued support of Cakebot :smile_cat:
