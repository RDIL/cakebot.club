With today's new release, Cakebot is able to not only tell you the first 123 digits of Pi, it can also flip a coin for you.

### Usage

#### Coinflip

Simply run `+coinflip` :money_with_wings:

#### Pi

Very easy, just go ahead and drop `+pi` in a text channel for your mathematical needs.

And as always, you can find out more about the commands [from the docs](../commands.md#fun).
