Having problems with the bot? Want a certain feature added? Well, you are in luck.

## Ways to get help

### The faster way

The faster of the two ways is to use our `report` command. This can be executed in any channel the bot has access to.
Example:

```none
+report Hello! Please add ____ command that does ____. Thanks!
```

Basic documentation can be found [here](./commands.md#help).

### The slower way

The slower of the two ways is to [shoot us an email](mailto:me@rdil.rocks).
