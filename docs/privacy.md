We take your privacy very seriously.

## Website

When you visit our website (https://cakebot.club and all subpages), we do not store cookies, or use trackers of any kind.
We employ [`DNSSEC` technology](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en), and have SSL enabled at all times.

## Support Tickets

When you file a support ticket, it is publicized while open. It does include your Discord username and tag so we can get back to you.
All tickets are kept after being closed.

> Tickets can be deleted upon request to a team member from the author.

## Error Logging

If an error within our code triggers while you are executing a command, we will capture your Discord username, ID, and discriminator.

This data is stored by [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

This privacy policy may change without warning if the team decides.

## Final Notes

Any questions should be directed to [our public email](mailto:me@rdil.rocks).
