Cakebot is a Discord bot written in TypeScript, with a focus on content, integrations, and freedom of use.

## Get the Bot

See [**this page**](/invite) for instructions on adding the bot to your server.

After installing, go ahead and drop a `+help` in any channel the bot has access to.
It will let you know of all the commands you can use :smile:!
